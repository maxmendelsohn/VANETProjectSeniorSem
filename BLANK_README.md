<h3 align="center">Comparison of Routing Time Delays for VANETS using Q-Learning</h3>


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The purpose of this project is to apply q-learning to existing veins-inet methods for the purpose of testing time delays using AODV, DSDV, and GPSR as routing protocols.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Installation of this project requires OMNeT++ 5.7 SPECIFICALLY, as well as proper importing of veins and inet.


### Installation

For proper importation of veins-inet, veins must be imported while taking into account its 
subprojects, otherwise it may not function properly. There being a copy of veins-inet within
the given project does not change this, as it still needs to be imported through OMNeT for.

Additions have been made to veins-inet subproject to create vehicle network models that 
act as routers

See OMNeT documentation for more.
