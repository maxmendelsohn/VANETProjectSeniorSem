Comparison of Routing Time Delays for VANETs using Q-Learning

Jabed Miah, Max Mendelsohn, and Daniel Buccisano

The purpose of this project is to apply q-learning to existing veins-inet methods 
for the purpose of testing routing protocols

Installation of this project requires OMNet 5.7 as well as proper importing of veins and inet
Both veins and inet with their required versions are apart of this repo and can therefore be
imported through the repo directly.

For proper importation of veins-inet, veins must be imported while taking into account its 
subprojects, otherwise it may not function properly.

Additions have been made to veins-inet subproject to create vehicle network models that 
act as routers

See OMNet documentation for more.
