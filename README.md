Comparison of Routing Time Delays for VANETs using Q-Learning

Jabed Miah, Max Mendelsohn, and Daniel Buccisano

The purpose of this project is to apply q-learning to existing veins-inet methods 
for the purpose of testing time delays using AODV, DSDV, and GPSR as routing protocols.

Installation of this project requires OMNeT++ 5.7 SPECIFICALLY, as well as proper importing of veins and inet.

For proper importation of veins-inet, veins must be imported while taking into account its 
subprojects, otherwise it may not function properly. There being a copy of veins-inet within
the given project does not change this, as it still needs to be imported through OMNeT for.

Additions have been made to veins-inet subproject to create vehicle network models that 
act as routers

See OMNeT documentation for more.
